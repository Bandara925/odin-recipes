Tips on when to commit
Don’t forget everything we went over in the Commit Messages lesson!

When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

After you have entered git push origin main, switch over to your browser and open your repository on GitHub. You should now see all the files you just pushed.
